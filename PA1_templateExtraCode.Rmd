Set global options: 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load libraries:
```{r libraries}
library(ggplot2)
library(timeDate)
```


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loadData}
# Load the data
filePath <- "/Users/joselle4/Documents/Programming/R/coursera/activity.csv"
activity <- read.csv(filePath, header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA")
activityClean <- na.omit(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment, ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r totalSteps}
# Calculate mean steps per day
meanDailySteps <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by = list(activity$date),
                       FUN = mean)
colnames(meanDailySteps) <- c("date", "steps")
head(meanDailySteps)

# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
sumDailySteps <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by = list(activity$date),
                       FUN = sum)
colnames(sumDailySteps) <- c("date", "steps")
summary(sumDailySteps)
head(sumDailySteps)
```

2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r histogram}
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(sumDailySteps$steps, xlab = "Toatl Steps", 
     main = "Total Steps per Day")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r reportMeanAndMedian}
# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number
# of steps taken per day
mean(sumDailySteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(sumDailySteps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r meanActivity}
# calcualte the average steps 
aveStepsByInterval <- aggregate(activity$steps ~ activity$interval, 
                                FUN = mean)
colnames(aveStepsByInterval) <- c("interval", "steps")
summary(aveStepsByInterval)
head(aveStepsByInterval)

# create time series plot
gg <- ggplot(data = aveStepsByInterval, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + 
    geom_line() + xlab("Interval [5min]") + 
    ylab("Ave Steps Across All Days") + 
    ggtitle("Time Series Plot: Ave Steps by Interval")
gg
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r maxStepsByInterval}
# use which function to obtain max number of steps per interval
aveStepsByInterval[which.max(aveStepsByInterval$steps), ]
```

## Imputing missing values
1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s
```{r totalNA}
sum(is.na(activity))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r fillNA}
# create new data activity
fillActivity <- activity
for (i in 1:nrow(fillActivity)) {
    if(is.na(fillActivity$steps[i])) {
        fillActivity$steps[i] <- aveStepsByInterval$steps[which(aveStepsByInterval$interval == fillActivity$interval[i])] 
    }
}

head(fillActivity)
head(activity)
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r makeHist}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
sumDailyStepsImp <- aggregate(fillActivity$steps, 
                       by = list(fillActivity$date),
                       FUN = sum)
colnames(sumDailyStepsImp) <- c("date", "steps")

# create hist
hist(sumDailyStepsImp$steps, xlab = "Total Steps", 
     main = "Total Steps per Day (NA Imputed)")

# calculate mean and median
mean(sumDailyStepsImp$steps)
median(sumDailyStepsImp$steps)
```
By imputing the missing data, the mean now equals the median.  

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r factorWeekdays}
# fill new variable dayType as "weekday"
fillActivity$dayType <- "weekday"

# classify weekends
fillActivity$dayType[isWeekend(fillActivity$date)] <- "weekend"

# factor dayType
fillActivity$dayType <- factor(fillActivity$dayType)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
```{r}
# calcualte the average steps by inteval
aveStepsByInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dayType, 
                                fillActivity,
                                FUN = mean)
summary(aveStepsByInterval)

# plot weekday and weekend steps by interval
gg <- ggplot(data = aveStepsByInterval, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", aes(colour = dayType)) +
    facet_grid(dayType ~ ., scales="fixed", space="fixed") +
    xlab("Interval [5min]") + ylab("Ave Steps Across All Days") +
    ggtitle("Time Series Plot: Weekday and Weekend Ave Steps by Interval")
gg
```
